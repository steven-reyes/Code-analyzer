## Security Best Practices

To maintain a secure environment, follow these guidelines:

- **Environment Variables**:
  - Keep `.env` files out of public repositories.
  - Use `.env.example` as a reference and set sensitive values locally.

- **Containerization**:
  - Use Docker or Docker Compose to isolate the application environment.
  - Regularly update Docker images and dependencies.

- **Access Controls**:
  - Rotate keys and secrets periodically.
  - Limit access to sensitive resources based on roles.

- **Dependency Management**:
  - Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities using tools like `pip-audit` or `npm audit`.
  - Keep `requirements.txt` and `package.json` up to date.

- **Code Practices**:
  - Avoid hardcoding sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords).
  - Use secure coding guidelines to prevent injection attacks, XSS, etc.

---

## Security Tools and Resources

We recommend using the following tools to improve security:

- **Static Analysis**:
  - `bandit` for Python security linting.
  - `ESLint` with security plugins for JavaScript.

- **Dynamic Analysis**:
  - Use tools like `OWASP ZAP` or `Burp Suite` for testing web application security.

- **Container Security**:
  - Use `Docker Bench` or similar tools to harden container environments.
